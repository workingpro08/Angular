-->Angular uses components as building blocks of the application.
  ->It divides whole user interface into multiple reusable parts called as components.
  ->Components are used for reusability,modularity and flexibility in application.
  ->Every component created in angular will have 4 files.These four files are only for that particular component:
    1.component-name.component.html
    2.component-name.component.ts
    3.component-name.component.css
    4.component-name.component.spec.ts

  ->1.component.html file is also called as template file.it is used for view.
  ->2.component.ts file is also called as component file.it is used for logic(model & controller).
  ->3.component.css file is also called as styling file.it is used for design and style and it is optional.
  ->4.component.spec.ts file is also called testing file.it is used for unit testing.

-->"Data Binding":It is a mechanism that connects template(html) and component(ts) files of a component.
   There are two ways of Data Binding possible in Angular.
    1.One way Data binding.
    2.Two way Data binding.
    
  ->1.One way Data binding:Using one way Data binding,we can connect data from component file to template file 
      or template file to component file.
    a.component file to template file:
      ->String Interpolation:we can send values from component to template using string interpolation.it uses double braces {{}}.
        eg://app.component.ts
           export class AppComponent{
            fruitname:string="apple"
            }
          //app.component.html
          <p>My fav fruit is {{fruitname}}</p> //output:My fav fruit is apple

      ->Event Binding:It is used to send event or trigger a function by an event from HTML(template) to TS(component).
        eg://app.component.html
           <button (click)="display()">click me</button>
          //app.component.ts
          export class AppComponent{
            display(){
              console.log("hello world");
            }
          }
      
      ->Property Binding:String interpolation always takes the from TS(component) to HTML(template) as a string no matter what 
         it's actual type.so,it is recommended to use property binding for all the properties from TS to HTML.
        ->Property binding uses square brackets to wrap properties/attributes.
          eg://app.component.ts
             export class AppComponent{
              url="https://www.google.com";
              isRequired=false;
            }
            //app.component.html
            <a [href]="url">click me</a>
            <input type="text" [required]="isRequired"/>

  ->2.Two way Data binding:In angular,it is possible to send the data from HTML to TS or TS to HTML of a component at a time.
    ->To achieve this we need to use "ngModel" to implement two way data binding.ngModel is available in formsModule.
    
    ->step-1:import formsModule since it has ngModel in app.module.ts and also write it in imports.
      //app.module.ts
      import {formsModule} from '@angular/forms'
      imports: [formsModule]
     
      //app.component.ts
      export class AppComponent{
        data:string='';
     }

      //app.component.html
      <input placeholder="enter text" type="text" [(ngModel)]="data" />
