Angular uses  components as the Building Blocks of the application. It divides whole User Interface into multiple reusable parts called as components
 components are used for reusability, modularity and flexibility in application

 Every component created in angular will have 4 files. These four files are only for that component
   component-name.component.html
   component-name.component.ts
   component-name.component.css
   component-name.component.spec.ts

1. component.html file is also called as Template file. it is used for view
2. component.ts file is also called as component file. it is used for logic (model & controller)
3. component.css file is also called as styling file. it is used for design and style and it is optional
4. .spec.ts file is also called testing file. it is used for unit testing

Data Binding: It is a mechanism that connects template(html) and component(ts) files of a component
  There are two ways of Data Binding possible in Angular.
  i. one way Data binding
  ii. Two way Data Binding

  i.one way Data Binding: Using One way Data Binding, we can connect data from component file to template file or template file to component file
    a. component file to template File:
       String Interpolation: we can send values  from component to template using String Interpolation. it uses double braces {{}}
       eg: //app.component.ts
       export class AppComponent{
         fruitname:string="apple"
       }
       //app.component.html
       <p> My fav fruit is {{fruitname}} </p>
    event Binding: It is used to send event or triggere a function by an event from HTML(Template) to TS(component)
    //app.component.html
    <button (click)="display()">click me</button>
    //app.component.ts
     export class AppComponent{
          display(){
            console.log("hello world")
          }
      }
   Property Binding: String Interpolation always takes the from TS(component) to HTML(template) as a string no matter what it's actual type. so, it is recommanded to use property binding for 
   all the properties from TS to HTML.  Property Binding uses sqaure brackets to wrap properties/attributes.
   eg: //app.component.ts
   export class AppComponent{
      url="https://www.google.com";
      isRequired=false;
   }
   //app.component.html
   <a [href]="url">click me</a>
   <input type="text" [required]="isRequired" />

  2. Two way Data Binding: 
     In angular , it is possible to send the data from HTML to TS or TS to HTML of a component at a time.
     To achieve this we need to use "ngModel" to implement two way data binding. ngModel is available in formsModule.

     step 1: import formsModule since it has ngModel in app.module.ts
     also write it in imports
     //app.module.ts
     import {formsModule} from '@angular/forms'
     imports: [formsModule]
     
     //app.component.ts
     export class AppComponent{
      data:string=''
     }

     //app.component.html
     <input placeholder="enter text" type="text" [(ngModel)]="data" />
