->"Routing":Routing is used to navigate from one web page to another web page.
 ->Angular uses separate module for routing called Routing module.
 ->Each Route specifies its path and its component to render.
 ->All Routes are mentioned within Routes Array.

->step-1:create paths with components in app-routing.module.ts
 ->const routes:Routes=[
    {path:'',component:HomeComponent},
    { path:'about',component:AboutComponent},
    {path:'contact',component:ContactComponent}
    ];
->step-2:mention <router-outlet> whereever we need components to come.
->step-3:use routerLink instead of href in anchor tags to avoid page reload.
