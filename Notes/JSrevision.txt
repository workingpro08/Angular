-->"Javascript Revision":
   i.What is the difference between let,var,const?
    ->var can redeclare and reassign,let and const cannot redeclare but let can reassign.
    ->let and const are block scoped,but var is a function scoped.
      eg:function fun(){
         if(true)
         {
            var x=20;
         }
        console.log(x);//output:20
     }

   ii.What is a callback function?
     ->function in the parameters of another function is called callback function.
       eg:function x(){
        }
        function y(a){
           a()
        }
        y(x)

   iii.How to implement class in javascript?
      ->class is a container/collection of objects/blueprint of an object.class contains methods and attributes.
        eg:class Teacher{
            name;salary;subject;
            teach();
         }
         ->create an object to class:
         let obj=new Teacher()
         ->Every class have a constructor which will be invoked automatically when an object is created.
         ->constructor is default method which is used to initialize values.
           class Teacher{
               name;salary;subject;
               constructor(a,b,c){
                     this.name=a,
                     this.salary=b,
                     this.subject=c
                 }
               }     
            let obj=new Teacher("saiteja",35000,"physics")
            console.log(obj.name);//output:saiteja

         ->classes have inheritance(child classes acquire properties from parent class).
           class Staff extends Teacher{
               id;
             constructor(x,a,b,c){
                 super(a,b,c);
                 this.id=x;
               }
            }
         let obj2=new Staff(25,"teja",55000,"maths")
         console.log(obj2.name);//output:teja

   iv.What is ES6 module system?
     ->ES6 module system is used to make communication between multiple js/ts files.
     ->It uses two keywords,'export' for exporting a value/method.'import' for importing a value.
     ->We can export lot of values but only one default value.
     ->We can import all the values within {} but default values doesn't need any braces.

->In JS,there are datatypes(number,string,boolean,undefined,null,array,object).
