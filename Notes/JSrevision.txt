Javascript Revision:
   i.  what is the difference between let,var,const?
  var can redeclare and reassign, let and const cannot redeclare but let can reassign.
 let and const are block scoped  but var is a function scoped
     function fun(){
         if(true)
          {
            var x=20;
           }
        console.log(x)
     }
  ii.  what is a callback function?
          function in the parameters of another function
        function x(){
        }
        function y(a){
           a()
        }
        y(x)
      
   iii.  how to implement class in javascript
             class is a container/collection of objects/blueprint of an object. class contains methods and attributes
          class Teacher{
              name;salary;subject;
              teach();
          }
     create an object to class:
         let obj=new Teacher() 
     Every class have a constructor which will be invoked 
     automatically when an object is created. constructor is default method which is used to initialize values
         class Teacher{
                name;salary;subject;
                 constructor(a,b,c){
                      this.name=a,
                      this.salary=b,
                      this.subject=c
                 }
               }     
              let obj= new Teacher("prasad",35000,"physics")
             console.log(obj.name)

     classes have inheritance(child classes aquire properties from parent class)
          class Staff extends Teacher {
               id;
              constructor(x,a,b,c){
                 super(a,b,c);
                 this.id=x;
                }
           }
      let obj2 = new Staff(25,"shekhar",55000,"maths")
     console.log(obj2.name);

iv.  what is ES6 module system ?
          ES6 module system is used to make communication between multiple js/ts files.
   it uses two keywords , 'export' for exporting a value/method
   'import' for importing a value
      we can export lot of values but only one default values.
      we can import all the values within {} but default values doesn't need any braces 

In JS, there are datatypes (number,string,boolean,undefined,null ,array,object)
